This is My Board Game List web application.

Currently, it's in progress as time is my limiting factor.

Eventually, I will add account creation and the ability to create lists of your favorite board games.
Lastly, there will be a feature to send yourself a text whenever a game you want goes on sale.

This is a full-stack web application made with a React front-end, Node/Express back-end, and a MongoDB database.
