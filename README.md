This is My Board Game List web application.

Currently, the only functionality is searching for board games and receiving basic data about these games.

Eventually, I will add account creation and the ability to create lists of your favorite board games.
Lastly, there will be a feature to send yourself a text whenever a game you want goes on sale.

This is a full-stack web application made with a React front-end, Node/Express back-end, and a MongoDB database.
